# Asteroids

**Player Movement**

To *move* the ship fowards, backwards, left, or right, use the WASD keys or the arrow keys. 

Move your mouse around the screen to *aim* the ship and click the mouse to *shoot*.

**Goal**

The goal of this game is to shoot the "germs" floating around the screen. If you collide with a germ you will respawn.

**Additional Features (included outside of minimum required elements)**

I added functionality that allowed the player to shoot pill bullets at the germs. When a bullet hits a germ the bullet is deleted and the germ spawns two smaller, discolored germs. If these smaller germs are hit they will delete without spawning new germs.

In addition to the added shooting functionality I drew up custom sprites for the game so as to make it more aesthetically interesting!

Lastly, I attempted to play with the animation object in unity in hopes of animating my sprites, but I wasn't able to figure out how to implement it successfully.
